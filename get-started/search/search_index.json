This document serves as a step-by-step guide for beginners to get started with FRC robot programming. If you follow the steps through the end, you will be able to drive a basic robot with your code by push of a button! How exciting! So let's dig in. Preparation Here are some necessities you'll have to cover: Laptop Bring a laptop computer with: Intel Core i5/7 CPU, minimum 8GB memory and 256 GB storage 3 USB ports, Wifi Built-in Ethernet port (highly desirable) Class A-B USB cable Ethernet cable A local account (not Microsoft account) with admin rights (i.e. in the Administrators group) Windows 8/10 Chrome browser IMPORTANT: Remove any anti-virus software such as McCafee or Norton, disable Windows Defender , and turn off automatic Windows Update . NI Account The software from National Instruments (NI) requires login for download, you'll need to create an account on ni.com . The account is also required for license activation. GitHub Account You may be able to go through this guide without it, but you'll need your GitHub account to work with your team mates developing the robot code. Just create one on github.com now if you still don't have it.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#preparation","text":"Here are some necessities you'll have to cover:","title":"Preparation"},{"location":"#laptop","text":"Bring a laptop computer with: Intel Core i5/7 CPU, minimum 8GB memory and 256 GB storage 3 USB ports, Wifi Built-in Ethernet port (highly desirable) Class A-B USB cable Ethernet cable A local account (not Microsoft account) with admin rights (i.e. in the Administrators group) Windows 8/10 Chrome browser IMPORTANT: Remove any anti-virus software such as McCafee or Norton, disable Windows Defender , and turn off automatic Windows Update .","title":"Laptop"},{"location":"#ni-account","text":"The software from National Instruments (NI) requires login for download, you'll need to create an account on ni.com .

Make sure you have a stable and decent Internet connection. FRC Update Suite by NI ( National Instruments ) NI software provides the Driver Station and tools for imaging the roboRIO, which is the brain that operates the robot. Instead of repeating the instruction, following below WPI instruction to download and install the suite. Go to http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2017/7904/en/, and click the link FRCUpdateSuite_2019.2.0.zip . You'll be prompted to log in, create an account if needed. After downloaded, unzip the zip file to a local folder, go into the folder and double-click setup.exe to start installation. On most of the installation wizard screens you click \"Next\" to move along. Pay attention to a few screens below: Enter Team7587's license activation code B04P65237 on this window: Ensure to accept 2 license agreements: Note the warning on Windows firewall, and make sure you pick \"Allow Access\" whenever prompted: IMPORTANT: Make sure you tick the checkbox to run license manager at the end of installation: When license manager starts, if you already logged in on the ni.com site, it's most likely that the serial number you entered above is already populated; if not, just enter it again, then click the 'Activate' button: After activating the license, restart the laptop as prompted. After reboot, you should see two icons below on your desktop: That indicates the NI software has been installed successfully. FRC Development Tools by WPI ( Worcester Polytechnic Institute ) WPI is the official software development tooling provider for FRC. In 2019 WPI deprecated Eclipse and started pushing Visual Studio Code as the new standard IDE. The original WPI instruction is here . A single \"one-stop-shop\" installer replaces previous multi-step manual process, and takes care of all the software pieces needed for programming. NOTE: The WPI package installer contains a specific JDK version (v11), do not use any JDK outside of the installed package. Go to https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases to download the latest version; at this point it's either WPILibInstaller_Windows64-2019.4.1.zip (for 64-bit Windows) or WPILibInstaller_Windows32-2019.4.1.zip (for 32-bit Windows). The file is close to 1 GB, it will take some time. Save the downloaded file to a local folder. To determine your Windows version, go to Control Panel and open System , look for \"System type\" field. The downloaded zip file contains only a single file with same name but .exe file extension, extract it to a the same folder, double-click it to start the installation. To extract the file, right-click it and choose 'Extract All'. The installer will initially have the two checkboxes \"Visual Studio Code\" and \"Visual Studio Code Extensions\" disabled (see below). You need to click \"Select/Download VS Code\" button to download it first. The downloaded file is OfflineVsCodeFiles-1.3x.1.zip and will be placed in the same folder as the installer. Leave it there and don't open it. Back on WPILib Installer, check the two \"Visual Studio Code...\" checkboxes, and click \"Execute Install\" to start the full installation process. After a while you'll get a prompt confirming the installation is completed, and see below 3 icons placed on the desktop. Double-click the icon \"FRC VS Code 2019\" to launch the IDE, type Ctrl+Shift+P . A command pallet shows up on the top, type in \"WPILIb\" and you should see a list of WPILib commands show up. This confirms that the installation is successful. Note: The installation places all the files in the folder C:\\Users\\Public\\frc2019 , this way all users on the laptop can access them. 3. Phoenix Framework by CTRE ( Cross The Road Electronics ) In order to use the Talon SRX motor controller, the Phoenix Software Package from its manufacturer CTRE is required. Installation is straightforward: 1. Visit http://www.ctr-electronics.com/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources 2. Click the link CTRE Phoenix Framework Installer 5.15.0.1 (.zip) to download the zip package 3. The zip file contains a single file with same name but .exe extension, extract it out to local folder 4. Double-click it to start the installation (it will require admin rights) 5. If you see below alert window, click 'Install' to continue: After installation completes, the Phoenix Tuner icon shows up on your desktop: More information on Phoenix Software can be found here . Now that you have the development environment set up, move on to start configuring the roboRIO.","title":"Environment Setup"},{"location":"env-setup/#environment-setup","text":"A set of software components must be installed on the laptop, which is to be the Driver Station of your robot.
